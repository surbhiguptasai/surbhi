<h2>NDTV NEWS:</h2>
<p style="color:red;">DIBRUGHAR:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi today beat a large traditional drum in Dibrugarh, Assam, to signal the beginning of the BJP's election campaign in Assam and in a public address lashed out at the Congress' Gandhis.
Without naming them, the Prime Minister said "one family" was responsible for the disruptions in Parliament that have stalled important legislative business and reforms and said he wondered if they were exacting "revenge" for their defeat in the national election of 2014.
"There are leaders in opposition parties who want Parliament to run even as they oppose me, but one family is too rigid to allow the Rajya Sabha to function," PM Modi said, asking Assam to give his BJP a chance in elections due by April.
"The Prime Minister's job is to run the country not make excuses," retorted Rahul Gandhi, speaking to the media in Delhi. "For the past 1.5 years Narendra Modi is the PM... He should start running the country," the Congress vice-presidents aid, claiming "even industrialists are crying saying this government is not doing what they promised for us."
The Budget session of Parliament begins later this month and the government hopes to push through important reforms like the Goods and Services Tax Bill, stalled repeatedly in the Rajya Sabha by the Congress which has a majority in the Upper House.
The BJP hopes to reverse the equation in the upper house, whose members are elected by state assemblies, by winning more state elections. Elections will be held in five states by April, including in Assam, which is ruled by the Congress.  
PM Modi said today that the Congress has neglected the welfare of the state and said development would "become a reality if there is a government in Assam which listens to the Centre."
The Congress swept the the 2011 assembly elections, winning 78 seats. The BJP got 5 seats, and won a by-election later in the year.
However, in the Lok Sabha elections the BJP won 7 of Assam's 14 seats, and fancies its chances at extending the good run to this year's assembly election.</p>

<h3>CNN NEWS</h3>
<p class="stylepara2">With the Lunar New Year just around the corner, many Chinese people are in the holiday spirit -- gifting cash-stuffed red envelopes and even consulting fortune-tellers to divine what's in the cards.
Seeking a fortune-teller's advice is no laughing matter in China, where feng shui and other traditional belief systems are still used to tackle life's most pressing issues, from romantic prospects to business deals.
CNNMoney decided to pose one of the biggest questions we have these days to Hong Kong fortune-teller Master Kelvin Poon: What exactly is in store for China's economy?
For some extra insight, we also ran his predictions by another professional forecaster, IHS China economist Brian Jackson. Here's what they say lies ahead in the Year of the Monkey.
The big picture
"China's economy will fluctuate a lot this year," Poon said. "The first half will be very slow, but the second half, after Aug. 8, will be much better."
That date is a key turning point, as a new energy -- what the Chinese call "qi" -- will take hold, he said.
Poon's prediction gets the timing right, according to Jackson, but the economist cited more mundane reasons for his opinion.
"It's pretty obvious in the data -- in the first half of the year, things are going to be very tough for China," he said. "I don't know that anybody would disagree with that."
A key gauge of manufacturing activity just came in at a 42-month low. And China's economy grew at 6.9% last year -- its slowest rate in 25 years.
Things aren't looking great for the coming year, either. Economists surveyed last month by CNNMoney are forecasting 6.5% GDP growth for 2016.
Roller-coaster markets
Chinese stock markets took investors on a tumultuous ride last year during which a dizzying rise gave way to a spectacular summer crash. The losses have deepened further in recent weeks.
Poon sees more fluctuations ahead but recommends buying into tech, telecom and food and beverage stocks in the early part of the year, when the element of fire is more prominent.
Jackson agrees on more market turmoil: "Everyone has known for a long time that China's stock market is basically a casino."
Beijing needs to implement more market-friendly policies, he said, and investors need to understand that the government won't be around to bail them out the next time share prices plummet.
"Until that happens, it's just going to function like a casino based on rumors," Jackson said.</p>

<h3>The Times Of India News</h3>
<p id="stylepara3">MEERUT: In the first major verdict pertaining to the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots cases, a Muzaffarnagar court has acquitted 10 people who had been charged with arson and murder of a 10-year-old boy and a 30-year-old woman in Lonk village of the district on September 8, 2013. The BJP erupted in celebrations soon after upper district judge Arvind Kumar Upadhyaya let off all the accused for want of evidence.
Soon after the incident three years ago, the SIT probing the riots had found 10 persons responsible for the crime. A case was registered against them at the Phugana police station and the accused were named.

At a time when assembly bypoll to the Muzaffarnagar seat is just a week ahead, on February 13, the verdict has come as a shot in the arm for the BJP. Suresh Rana, one of the main accused in the riots and BJP MLA from Thana Bhawan in Shamli district, said, "The verdict has exposed the reality in front of the public. Thousands of innocent Hindus had been framed in the riots by the local administration at the behest of the ruling Samajwadi Party. Such was the blatant misuse of power that 11 persons named as accused were not even alive at that point of time. The verdict will go a long way in teaching a lesson to the Samajwadi Party, especially as it heads for the 2017 UP assembly elections."
Rihana Adeeb, director, Astitva, an NGO working towards the rehabilitation of riot victims, said, "A woman was killed, a child was murdered. Arson also took place. This is a fact and no one can deny it. If these men did not commit the crime, someone did. I cannot challenge the court verdict, but we had a lot of faith in the legal system. This is utterly sad."
